# Baja Seat Covers: Project Documentation and Technical Overview

## Motivation

The project originates from a practical need to address worn car seats without investing in costly replacements. The approach is utilitarian: cover the existing upholstery with readily available materials to extend usability.

## Problem Statement

Replacing car seat upholstery is often expensive and time-consuming. This project seeks a low-cost, low-effort alternative that provides functional coverage, accepting aesthetic compromises.

## Implementation Details

The core method involves draping blankets over the front seats, cutting holes for the headrests, and sewing the fabric to secure the covers. The process is manual and straightforward, relying on basic sewing skills rather than specialized upholstery techniques.

The repository contains an `index.md` file documenting the plan, execution, and outcome, supplemented by images stored in a compressed archive. These images provide visual reference points for the fitting and sewing process.

## Technical Considerations

- Material choice is limited to blankets, which affects durability and appearance.
- Sewing is used primarily to prevent movement of the covers rather than to achieve a tailored fit.
- The covers are flipped inside out post-sewing, likely to hide seams and create a cleaner exterior.

## Practical Notes

This project is not intended as a commercial or polished solution but as a functional stopgap. The documentation serves as a reference for similar future endeavors or for revisiting the project to iterate on design and technique.

## Summary

This repository captures a pragmatic approach to automotive interior maintenance. It prioritizes cost-effectiveness and simplicity, documented through markdown notes and photographic evidence. The project is a useful case study in DIY problem-solving with minimal resources.
